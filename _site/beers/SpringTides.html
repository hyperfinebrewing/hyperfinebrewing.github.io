<p>4% ABV tart and highly effervescent ale conditioned with a combination of Raspberry and Passionfruit. Brewed with locally malted wheat and barley, and lightly hopped with Humulus lupulus var. neomexicanus, a native and genetically distinct sub-species of hops growing wild for the last million years in the American Southwest. These hops round out the fruity bouquet of the beer, imparting intense guava, melon, apricot and citrus fruit flavors and aroma. The beer is fermented with a combination of Lactobacillus plantarum and a wild Saccharomyces yeast isolated from local flora.</p>
