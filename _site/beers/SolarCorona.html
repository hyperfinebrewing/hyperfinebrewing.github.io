<p>6.2% ABV golden ale, aged for 12-18 months in oak rum barrels before a final conditioning period on Alphonso mangoes. The characteristic flavors of this beer, such as pineapple, rhubarb, cherry, and hay (all lovingly referred to as ‘funky’ by craft beer enthusiasts) are created through the long and complex synthesis of organic compounds by a host of fermenting organisms, including Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Brettanomyces, and Saccharomyces. The rich, sweet, and tropical flavors of the mango compliment the fruity funk of the Golden Ale, and accentuate the coconut and vanilla imparted by the oak barrel.</p>
