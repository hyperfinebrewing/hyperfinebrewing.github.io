Our take on the ever popular NEIPA. Medium bodied 6.5% ABV ale bursting with juicy hops. A combination of Citra, Mosaic, and Amarillo hops impart a medley of citrus, berry, and tropical fruit flavors and aromas. The juiciness is enhanced by a touch of bright fruity acidity contributed by Lactobacillus plantarum. Malted oats and a carefully selected yeast strain make for a smooth creamy body and softly balanced palette.
