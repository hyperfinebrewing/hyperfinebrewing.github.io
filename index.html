		<h2>What we're up to</h2>
		<p>
		At Hyperfine, we're currently exploring the fascinating world of sour beer. From sophisticated and mature barrel aged sours, to sour interpretations of popular new styles like the New England IPA, we are leaving no stone unturned. Partnering with yeast labs and fermentation experts, we are expanding our understanding of the microbiology behind sour beer production, and applying our knowledge to create superlative products.
		</p>

		<h2>In the works</h2>
		<ul class="beer_list">
			<li>
				<div class="title">Sour IPA Series</div>
				<div class="description">Sour renditions of the New England IPA style. Fruity, hop forward, tart and refreshing, these beers epitomize “juiciness”.</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="title">Golden Sour</div>

				<div class="description">Aged for 12-18 months in oak barrels, aged with fruit, herbs, or spices, and often blended into our other products to add a zip of acidity or tropical fruit flavor, this beer is the cornerstone of our brewing program. </div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="title">Sour Stout</div>
				<div class="description">Silky chocolate, smooth vanilla, and rich coffee flavors combine with a mild acidity to produce what we best describe as chocolate covered fruit. A beer designed for special occasions and long term cellaring.</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="title">Sour Red</div>
				<div class="description">A modern rendition of a classic style. A Flander’s red base, aged in rum barrels, and blended with locally grown stone fruits and berries creates a complex and layered beer. It will take you on a flavor journey through lemony acidity, ripe cherry, deep leather and tobacco, and spiced rum. </div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div class="title">Berliner Weisse with Local Yeast</div>
				<div class="description">Featuring our house yeast strain isolated from an oak tree in Fresh Pond, It produces light clove, jasmine, and banana flavors - enhancing the tart, highly effervescent, and crisp qualities of the beer. </div>
			</li>
		</ul>
