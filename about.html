		<h2>What we're up to</h2>
		<p>
		At Hyperfine, we're currently exploring the fascinating world of sour beer. From sophisticated and mature barrel aged sours, to sour interpretations of popular new styles like the New England IPA, we are leaving no stone unturned. Partnering with yeast labs and fermentation experts, we are expanding our understanding of the microbiology behind sour beer production, and applying our knowledge to create superlative products.
